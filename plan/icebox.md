# Icebox — deferred, opt-in next steps

How this plan works: see `/home/nthalk/CLAUDE.md` "Planning". These are queued, not active.

## Shipped (2026-07-21)
- ✅ **Port exclusions in config + Ports UI** — server-authoritative denylist (built-in ranges moved
  server-side + editable `Config.PortExclusions`); `GET /api/v1/ports` returns `{builtin, custom}`,
  `PUT /api/v1/ports/exclusions` edits; CLI honors them; new `/ports` UI page (Reservations + Exclusions
  tabs). Chose server-authoritative-with-seeded-builtins + enumerated ports/ranges (no wildcard syntax).
- ✅ **Hosts UX clarity** — Observability Hosts section now lists knownHosts (derived ∪ declared) with a
  source badge and a one-click "Declare / add labels" (prefills IP) on derived hosts.
